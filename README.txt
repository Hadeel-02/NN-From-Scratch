**Neural Network From Scratch** üß†
This project implements a neural network from scratch, focusing on key concepts like optimization, backpropagation, and residual connections. It includes both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.

üìå **Overview**
This project is divided into two main parts:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Classifier and Optimizer ‚Äì Implements a softmax classifier and an SGD optimizer with a learning rate decay.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Neural Network ‚Äì Covers both standard and residual neural networks, including forward/backward propagation and experiments on different architectures.

The notebook already contains outputs from previous runs. If you wish to rerun it, ensure all attached files are in the same folder.

**Note**: The **helpers.py** file contains code that is not directly related to the main functionality of the notebook. We offloaded this code to the external file to keep the notebook clean and focused. This file includes utility functions, imports, and the randomness seed setting for reproducibility.
